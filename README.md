# Terrain and River Network Visualization - Serbia

This project presents a 3D visualization of Serbia's terrain and river networks to support environmental planning, hydrological analysis, and resource management.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a 3D visualization of Serbia's terrain and river networks to support environmental planning, hydrological analysis, and resource management. Using QGIS, I integrated DEM and hydrological datasets to generate an accurate elevation model and highlight river networks. The visualization simplifies complex spatial data into an accessible and actionable tool for decision-makers, aiding in sustainable development and disaster preparedness. This project demonstrates my expertise in geospatial analysis, data integration, and map design.

## Tools and Data

- **Software:** QGIS  
- **Data Sources:** DEM (Digital Elevation Model), hydrological datasets
